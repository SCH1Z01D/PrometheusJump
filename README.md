ZuluJump [The Open Source comic generator]

The Ai model would use generative Ai and NLP to create the basic layout of a comic. From there it will publish the panels that were completed to the library page where it will store and take the title of the comic that the user has chosen. Then transfer it to the easy to access website where various other comics were published.

The structure would be:
1.  A large NLP model that will ask the user for the prompt.
2.  Then the processed text will be sent to the stable diffusion model and it will create the panels which will be displayed on the output page of the site.
3.  The user will be asked if they want to make changes to the comics in any sense or manner it will then change and redo the process of the text to image prompt
4.  Once the user is satisfied it will submit the final draft to the library page of the website

The main purpose of this project would be to create an outlet for creators who want to start their own comics without the hassle of building up the skill required for drawing the panels and they could just stick to the main scripts and ideas associated with the comic realm.

Stable diffusion and openais chatgpt as the basis of the translation of the text and the backbone of the whole project. These models will be implemented to create and modify the images produced and ensure the quality of the panels displayed.
